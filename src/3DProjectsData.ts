        "description": "In my last 3D class, which was the last level offered, we were given full creative freedom to create a scene of any kind that we'd like in order to combine all of the knowledge we'd amassed so far and more with research that would come along the way.\n\n\
                        I had dreamed of such an opportunity for a while because i was always SO inspired by the art in the newest Final Fantasy games. That stylized PBR look fascinates me to no end! My idea was to create a character in a scene that speaks of his grandiosity, of his power and opulence. I debated between a futuristic ancient egyptian style or Cyberpunk/StarWars and after long and arduous thought, my love for cyberpunk overtook my inspiration.\n\n\
                        I had already previously done PBR, so the style wasn't exactly new to me, but many techniques were. In my research, I found out about hair cards and how to render that FF hair, how to work with texture nodes in Blender, which was asuper insightful. Now granted I had many deadlines (and I mean I had several heavy and large assignments from other classes), There were some goals I couldn't reach. In the final result of the project, the hair isn't made with hair cards for instance, I used the path and circle technique to lay down the general form of each clumb of hair and used texture nodes to give it the hair detail. I also originally wanted to animate it myself, but sadly did not have the time. Instead, I made my final renders transparent so that I could put together the scene and an animated background that would bring it to life. I also edited the renders in proceate to bring some of the glowy details out that didn't come out the way I originally wanted them to.\n\n\
                        This class was focused more on project realization and resourcefulness. The goal was for us to make a plan and see it through with our own skills but with all the resources available to us. I textured every component myself using Blender texture nodes and Substance Painter. I modeled the all the environmental components besides some decoration and accessories which I downloaded for free off Sketchfab (all credits go to the artists): the sakura tree, katana stands, oni masks, robotic arm, the collar of the scion's clothes, and his boots. The paintings, the background gif in the animated version and the background image in the static version, are all images that I got from Google.",

                        For our project, the subject we chose is the deteriorating posture of the average first world person caused by overuse of mobile devices. The downward uncomfortable angle of the chair is meant to push the users in a position in which they actually feel comfortable browsing on their phones but otherwise uncomfortable. During the presentation, the feedback we received was exactly as expected; viewers immediately felt conscious about their posture, readjusted, and users actually felt comfortable while scrolling on their phones - less so trying to look up and talk to people, as intended.\n\n\
                        The renders were made to include in a pamphlet meant to represent an IKEA catalogue in a world in which the slouched position would be the new normal, and doubled as the informative leaflet of our installation.\n\n\
                        The scenes were modeled and taxtured in Blender entirely. The dining room and the study/office include early prototypes we had made that I included for the idea of a diverse choice of models. The bedroom includes the actual model of the chair we made.",

                        The bust was shaped with the goal of giving the illusion of a rest of the body but being neatly finished at the bottom rather than cut off in a straight line like traditional ones are. The texturing focused on a more realistic finish in which layers of dermis were painted to emulate the real colors of a human face. The eyes and lips were glossed likewise to give a wet and glossy natural look.\n\n\
                        The hair was created using the circle and path technique and it was then painted with a gradient color representing my own. There are a few different strands used to give it the volume and unevenness of real hair.\n\n\
                        The accessories include the headphones, the collar, the shirt and the camisole. The outfit itself was inspired by game and real life accessories I own but modified to make a cohesive outfit. The sleeves don't include arms to contribute to the nice shape of the bust. The camisole is drawn directly onto the model. Besides the basic fabric textures, I created my own alphas to create the golden dragon print on the shirt.",

        "description": "Nebula was the final project of my first 3D class. In this project, I compiled all I had learned to bring the character to life.\n\n\
                        The character was entirely modeled in Blender. I used the path technique to create the material needed for the body and sculpted the female body out of that shape. The hair was made using the path and circle technique using different kinds of strands to give Nebula her ponytail. In the scope of this project, we learned to use Substance Painter 3D to bake a high poly mesh into a low poly mesh once the sculpture had been fully retopologized. Because her catsuit is meant to be skin tight, I only further modelled the LED strips that pop out of her suit, the belt garters on her thigh and her high heels.\n\n\
                        The magic happened entirely in the texturing process. After the skin sections were painted, the suit was painted using the carbon fiber material while the LEDs were painted using a black mask and an emissive material.\n\n\
                        As for the animation, the rigging, weight painting, and mocap were all completed manually. It took some trial and error, but after some time, I managed to give Nebula her confident feminine walk as well as make it somewhat more natural by adding the head bobbing.\n\n\
                        Ideally I would've love to include more cloth simulation and hair wiggling, but this knowledge shall be applied to a newer project and better compilation of my modeling skills.",
