The goal was to get us used to the software and its tools (creation, rendering, animation) to prepare us for the following assignment which was the miniature sculpture with integrated stand.",

KDA, which stands for Kill/Death/Assist, is a virtual pop group that Riot created featuring Ahri and 4 other characters from the game. This is the first cosplay I ever entirely made from scratch!",
        "description": "I've been cosplaying since 2015 and after only doing casual and easy to put together or cheap to order cosplays, in 2019, I finally decided to make my own. A big reason was that I didn't find that any of the premade costumes were good enough to do this character/skin justice. I wanted it to be awe inspiring at the convention and for it to be perfect.\n\n\
                        With this cosplay, I learned how to use a sewing machine, and all the different kinds of materials that we can get creative with for the perfect finish. For example, to make her crystal tail, I used geometric PETG cutout shapes line with cello and filled with fairy lights to give it that shiny diamong look. I also used gold fabric instead of gold paint to cover the foam accessories to ensure a shiny yet flexible gold finish wherever I could't use vinyl.\n\n\
                        Wearing this cosplay was really worth all the effort to make it!",
