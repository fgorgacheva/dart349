    "description": "Raiden Shogun's sword, the \"Musou No Hitotachi\", from the game Genshin Impact. 3D remodeled, printed, painted, and decorated. I really wanted to bring to life the essence of the God and her element and I wanted her sword to be eye catching. I bought an .stl model from Etsy and entirely remodeled the inside to allow space for an LED strip, and redesigned the part attachment system. In the hilt, I made space for a round battery to which the LED strip would be connected.\n\n\
                    Once modeled and after printing a few test pieces, I printed the two hilt parts together which took about 3 days, followed by the three blade parts which took about 2 days all with 100% density on the highest quality using the Ender 3v2 printer. Once printed, I took off all the supports and sanded with a dremmel followed by very fine (800-200 grit) sandpaper to smooth the surface and got painting. I first painted the hilt separately because of house much I needed to manipulate and rotate the pieces. Once those were done, I put the whole sword together by inserting the LED strip all the way in and glueing each piece to the next. First time working with hsuch big PLA printed parts and everything was surprisingly easy to work with. The Krazy glue did wonders, and as the PLA is transparent, the seems and male/female attachments are barely visible! I then painted the details of the blade and finally spray painted it with a sealing glossy clear coat.\n\n\
                    The final result is a very sturdy sword with a battery powered LED that can be turned on and off via controller. Even the colors can change!",

        "brief": "Sculpture of a very tiny cat made to hang on a very big curtain as its integrated stand. Printed with Concordia's SLS printer.",
        "description": "For this project, we studied the art of integrated stands. We were tasked with making a very miniature sculpture that would be 3D printed using the SLS printer that would then use a a giant integrated stand. For example, a very tiny rubber duck in a giant bathtub, or a very tiny bee on a giant flower. I picked a very tiny cat climbing a very big curtain.\n\n\
                        I'm very happy with the way it turned out. The SLS printer is a printer that uses powder for support, each layer of material is laid on a layer of powder surroundind the model allowing for very fine and accurate details. I made its claws extra long and sharp to make it hang in the curtain as cats do. I ended up sewing a thread around its neck to make sure it doesn't fall off an break, In hidsight, I could've made small wholes between the neck and the paws to pass a red thread and make it look like its collar instead, but I had unfortunately not originally planned to sew it at all. But that's okay, we learn and that's how we do better in our future projects!",

        "description": "This sculpt was created as part off my 3D Sculpture and Print class. Our first assignment tasked us with creating an abstract piece of art that would later be integrated in a realistic picture of Montreal. The goal was to get us used to the software and its tools (creation, rendering, animation) to prepare us for the following assignment which was the miniature sculpture with integrated stand.",

KDA, which stands for Kill/Death/Assist, is a virtual pop group that Riot created featuring Ahri and 4 other characters from the game. This is the first cosplay I ever entirely made from scratch!",
        "description": "I've been cosplaying since 2015 and after only doing casual and easy to put together or cheap to order cosplays, in 2019, I finally decided to make my own. A big reason was that I didn't find that any of the premade costumes were good enough to do this character/skin justice. I wanted it to be awe inspiring at the convention and for it to be perfect.\n\n\
                        With this cosplay, I learned how to use a sewing machine, and all the different kinds of materials that we can get creative with for the perfect finish. For example, to make her crystal tail, I used geometric PETG cutout shapes line with cello and filled with fairy lights to give it that shiny diamong look. I also used gold fabric instead of gold paint to cover the foam accessories to ensure a shiny yet flexible gold finish wherever I could't use vinyl.\n\n\
                        Wearing this cosplay was really worth all the effort to make it!",
