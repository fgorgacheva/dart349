        "brief": "In this case study, I explore the details of my virtual library's design process, sharing insights and lessons from my creative journey. Using Procreate for sketching and Figma for design, I ultimately developed it using React JS.",
        "descriptions": ["My portfolio has been through a roller coaster. Going from hyper focused, to broader, from dark theme to light theme. It was honestly very difficult to figure out what to do and how to do it, given that I pursue multiple differing creative paths. I wanted a portfolio I would be proud of, one I would be confident applying for jobs with but also one where I could also collect my life’s work that I could use to share with contacts. But how does one coherently put all these things together in a way that make sense? We’re talking CV, curated portfolio, galleries of different kinds of work. It was not an easy task.\n\n\ I went threw a few iterations, tested them against a number of people and used the feedback to improve and ultimately revamp the entire design to something that is much more me than it was previously.",
                        "The original design was inspired by dark futuristic themes. As I am a dark theme kind of person and I have a special place in my heart of anything cyberpunk, I really thought this was what represented my personality the most.",
                        "Though it was not a terrible portfolio by any means, it made me feel somewhat uncomfortable. It was dark themed and I let the colors of the projects fill in for the neutrality of the palette. The name in the top left was meant to be the navigation as well asa sort of breadcrumb indicating where the user is and my initials in the top right corner meant to be my contact information, always accessible from anywhere should the user want it. The logo would bring back to the home page. It made perfect sense to me and it turned out just as i had designed it, but it just didn’t feel right. So, I had it looked at and tested by users of various backgrounds. ",
                        "## Research \n\n\ As I grew more uncomfortable about my design, I decided to not only fix the grievances of my testers, but to just redesign the whole thing. After long and careful thought, the website didn’t meet my original requirements well enough on top of not passing the user tests well. I had to reassess what I wanted the final result to be like. Designing a better portfolio couldn’t be done without a lot more research about what a good portfolio represents. \n\n\ Researching and learning from more renowned UX designers’ portfolios was quite eye-opening as I compared my own to theirs. My head was too far in creating something modern and extravagant, when really simple and straight to the point is the way to go. But how to do that when I want to mix different disciplines?",
                        "These are the two greatest sources of inspiration that guided my current design. The first one is Lola Jiang’s portfolio. She’s a UX designer at Google and the simplicity of her website spoke to me as well as the color scheme. I always loved gloomy weather, so seeing the simplicity of a gloomy sky and the light gray colors right away let me know that I have to opt for a light theme. \n\n\ The second is one of my very close friend’s library. I’ve always looked up to him and to his work. I admire his ambition and his creativity and the way he was able to combine all the different kinds of things he can do in a library is what inspired my current design. As I also dabble in various subjects that I wish to collect and also use as portfolio, it seemed like a beautiful solution!",
                        "Although the aim was modernity and simplicity, I originally overdid it. I broke a few UX rules which despite still aligning with modernity only tarnished the users’ experience. Memory, choice, flow, target selection were all things that were not optimized.",
                        "As the navigation was a big issue, I had to make sure that it made sense visually to follow Jakob’s Law, but also to make the flow as straightforward and short as possible to ensure a fewest amount of clicks necessary for user to reach the information they need. ",
                        "When I started sketching the initial designs, I really wanted to put forward usability and access, I had to make sure I didn’t repeat the same mistakes, or what would have been the point? I made an intuitive navigation bar that always exists with icons, i made galleries of my works instead of having the users pick titles at random and I made sure that most of the related features are always accessible as error prevention, i.e. if a gallery is selected instead of a portfolio, it can still be accessed from there rather than have to go back and make a different selection. Concurrently, the gallery is accessible from the navigation bar.",
                        "I aimed for a glass design from the beginning. I love the weightless and modern feel it gives. I was very much inspired by the works of __ who makes mind blowing glass models and designs. Pairing design and my love for 3D, I wanted to model glass icons myself and use them in my design. It keeps the glass but it also gives pearly bubbles as well. Besides being an aesthetic I like and remain heavily themed, it’s also still neutral enough to let my projects speak for themselves and add their own colors!",
                        "In the final design, two features were modified for the sake of simplicity and sense when I began coding it. \n\n\ The first feature being the portfolio buttons that are part of the visual map. Originally it was meant to pop up on hover with an arrow. However, logistically, it was going to be difficult to add that arrow. Furthermore, it wasn’t intuitive that the big buttons would take to gallery while the smaller would take to portfolio. So, instead, I made two defined buttons appear above and below the UX and 3D boxes respectively for grouping, recognition and visibility. \n\n\ The second feature that changed is the display of the curated works for each portfolio. Initially, I wanted to keep the original side scrolling system I had in my first design; I thought it looked unique and fun and wanted to keep it, but as condensed version, i.e. not scrolling so all the works are directly visible. However, that entirely took away half the interactivity, as the giant title is supposed to be revealed as the thumbnails scroll over it. I instead opted for a more simple design that is straightforward and much easier to navigate.",
                        "## What Did I Learn? \n\n\ I remembered and old thing my coach had told me in my synchronized swimming years; simple and perfectly executed is far better than complex and poorly executed! When developing the website, that is really where I began to understand that quote and how much it applies in this context. It’s the entire point of UX! I spent a lot of time getting inspiration from websites on awwwards.com, but the thing is, complex and whimsical isn’t always better. Certainly interesting to look at, but always more demanding to integrate and nearly never necessary to guarantee a good experience for the users. \n\n\ As I made a virtual library with portfolio sections, that would in the end collect a lot of information, it is a lot more worth to focus on simplicity, direct access, and visibility. Reduce the clicks, get to the point, avoid confusion or questions as much as possible. I learned a whole lot about UX and how closely it is related to the development process, I am glad that I decided to develop it myself rather than use an external building tool. It not only gave me the chance to execute my creative freedom, but it taught me a lot in all regards of the process!"

Not only modernizing the general look and feel and staying true to the brand, but also optimizing this complex tool as much as possible. The design was created and prototyped in Adobe XD and its style guide was put together in Figma.",
        "descriptions": ["To understand my task better, I took the time to understand what the application really does and how it operates, find out what features are the ones we must put forward to increase the quality of life of the users. I worked alongside my client, always ensuring approval of the designs to realize their vision as best we can as well as the team of developers to ensure that all aspects of the design are feasible. When the whole team is on the same page, it ensures for a smooth design and development process!",
                        "This application manages a variety of complex data that needs to be quickly and easily accessible.

                        "The more complex data becomes, the more important relying on visual memory to ensure smooth navigation. For instance some information was required to always be visible like the navigation tabs, global alerts, temperature surrounding the monitored site, and quick access tools which i’ve placed in ribbons for direct access. ",
                        "Moreover, colors, grouping and recognizable icons also help with navigating a lot faster. Psychologically, our brains and eyes will scan and jump to the most obvious details or brightest colors. Based on recognition, certain colors come with certain meanings. It is important to use such things to our advantage as designers, not only when dealing with complex information, but whenever we wish to create designs that ensure the best user experience possible!",
                        "I worked on this project on call over the span of 3 years, so many aspects, features and details had time for redesign and change as the client’s requirements and needs evolved. Naturally more things were added and others modified, but always with the intention to keep things smooth, simple, and optimized.\n\n\ During that time, I was also tasked a number of times to design a logo for the application. As it went through many iteration and complete overhauls, it was still good experience for me to put some of my graphic skills to use. I learned much more about Adobe Illustrator as well as the tools offered in Figma for graphic design.\n\n\ In the end, I created a style guide to leave with the team of developers to make sure they have a reference to help keep everything consistent including color values, font families, distances, values of rounded corners and drop shadows, etc. The app covered such a vast amount of information that it called for quite a lot of attention to detail."

Students were tasks to find an issue in our daily lives and design an application that would remedy that issue. During the pandemic, as we were all forced to adapt to remote work and learning, the use of cameras became something often require and mostly disliked and I myself didn’t like opening my camera.",

                        "Research \n\n\ When considering this issue, my thoughts went to Vtubers and VRChat. Both platforms use virtual characters to disguise identities. Vtubers gained popularity for streaming without showing faces, while VRChat allows users to pick characters from galleries to use to represent themselves. \n\n\ In surveys conducted by myself among my classmates, the majority expressed a preference for keeping the camera off, while a little over half of them said they would opt for using an avatar if given the choice. Some valued body language in communication, while others saw it more as a temporary predicament. However, for important discussions, debates, assignments, and projects, seeing teammates together was considered optimal.",

Prioritizing user-friendly navigation to ensure all tools are easily accessible with quick access to characters for a seamless experience was key in this design. \n\n\ I always take the time to imagine myself using the applications I design; what kinda of experience do I want to have, what features do I need, would my friends or family be able to use this application easily? Quality of life is always extremely important.",
                        "## What did I learn? \n\n\ In this assignment, I learned to explore the common issues people face in their daily lives, come up with an idea for a tool that would remedy one of the issues, design it and conduct tests and surveys to improve features. \n\n\ I learned a lot about putting yourself in the shoes of the user and create a design that will reduce the risk of errors, encourage exploration, and ensure a seamless and smooth experience! \n\n\ Although this was a theoretical design exercise, with a background in computer science, I tried as much as possible to consider the development process of this application. The areas where I had more difficulty were the external connections between the applications to create that “plug and play” experience, I would have very much enjoyed to talk to someone with more expertise and learn about how this could be done successfully. As designers, it’s important to consider what can actually be executed in practice!",
