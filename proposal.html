            The midterm proposal consists of three parts: the proposal essay including research on the topic, the style guide, and the UX-UI design. This project will be about story telling and testing my skills in making something I've never attempted before. Using JS and other sub-libraries, I want to recreate and retell a story that my mother used to tell me when I was young. Frankly, many people missed out on this story, and I think more should learn about it.
          <br><br>
            In the essay portion, I've researched about why we, humans, like stories so much and what makes a compelling story in order to explain my choice, and quite honestly, explain to myself why stories compell me so much.
          <br><br>
            The style guide compiles my sources of inspiration as well as the artistic vision and direction I plan on taking.
          <br><br>
            Finally, the UX-UI design contains samples of my main ideas for the UI of my story application as well as some sketches of potential animations I will be attempting to include.
