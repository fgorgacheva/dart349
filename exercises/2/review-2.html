            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Simple, modern, and dark with a splash of color is a very nice way of making a site that only contains information about an individual inviting and fun to interact with.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>All the content is delivered to the user from the beginning and is easy to understand; to begin navigation, scroll, and to navigate information, all clickable links are obvious and inviting.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The content itself is somewhat boring, in my opinion, as it is just someoneâ€™s portfolio.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>This person has found a way to bring interest and to make people want interact with the content with a creative and inviting design, with the splash of color/spotlight following the mouse on a dark background and somewhat lifeless/colorless images is very fun.</p>
