            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Very modern, but the infinite scrollbar that loops back to the beginning once it reaches the end is somewhat confusing in that users may not be certain that they have looped back unless they noticed the small progression bar at the bottom that is partially hidden, it’s also not straightforward that that’s what that number is. The Site also does not seem to be designed for large screens because elements appear to overlay on top of eachother at some point.</p>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>The home page is quite simple to use and navigate, straightforward and no extra steps required to accomplish the main objectives which is to explore the various venues.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The content is interesting, and the pictures featured are inviting to explore more although that has more to do with photography than design, it’s important to have content and a design that compliment one another, and I think that’s been achieved here.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>This websites has features I’ve never seen before, and although creative and quite unique, are a little off putting; the diagonal and non-linear scrolling on the venue pages made me very uncomfortable and threw me off balance, I became confused with all the content feeling scattered that way.</p>
