            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The design is very simple and straightforward, it’s playful and very easy on the eyes even though there seems to be a lot of information.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>It is very easy to navigate, instructions are clearly indicated and simple to follow. The arrows indicating the direction the character should go in go out of the screen and are sometimes confusing, though.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The content is adorable and tell a little story about a beloved Korean character, Ryan, as well as be filled with easter eggs and fun little bits of information about him.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>The contrast of putting 3D models and assets telling a story in an otherwise 2D “doodle notebook” environment is very interesting and refreshing!</p>
