                <h1>Artist's Statement</h1>
                <p>
                    As a person, I am someone who is quite emotional and particularly nostalgic. Memories make me happy, sad, fill me with sadness for what is gone and with joy for what has been. <br><br>
                    As an artist, creating projects that touch upon those distant memories throws me on trips down memory lane! This is why I decided to recreate a little story from my childhood that my mother had taught me from a young age. It is still very relevant to me to this day; it comes up to my mind quite often as I continue to meet people who have not had the fortune of learning the moral of the story at an earlier age. <br><br>
                    Stories drive me. I’m a very visual person, so whenever I read stories, I have entire movies play out in my head. Either way, I see more and more that I love stories. From a very young age, I became obsessed with video games because they not only allowed me to learn a new story like in books, but it allowed me to be the main character, and on top of that, it was also like a movie! 3 in 1! I love games, books, tv shows, anecdotes, prompts, and all the things that make my mind run and imagine scenarios!  <br><br>
                    In summary, this project was meant to reflect and share my passion for stories, my love for my memories and my bittersweet attachment to nostalgia. It was also a lot of fun to figure out how to make something I’ve never made before!  <br><br>
