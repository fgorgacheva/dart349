        <h1>Fooooood!</h1>

      <!-- IDEA:  <p>All the trees turn red and orange, the weather gets a little cold making us look more for warmth. Pumpkins everywhere and everything; they're small, cute and sweet. Not to mention the holidays; Thanksgiving and Halloween are famous, but the Asian Mid-Autumn festival is also important, at least to me because my boyfriend is Chinese! Think of all the food! Turkey, potatoes, hot pot, cookies and candies, and mooncakes!
      Weather is cozier and calls for autumn and spooky movies to be watched wrapped in a blanket drinking pumpkin spice latte with marshmallows and cookies and popcorn with someone we love!

      Spooky! Cozy?
