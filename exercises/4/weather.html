        <h1>There's comfort in the fog...</h1>

        <p>
          Beginning of the season, when it starts to get cold, the clouds roll in and install themselves where they'll stay for a longer time. It gets darker, colder, maybe a little rainier. But rain is refreshing, it washes the old season away and welcomes the new one. It smells nice and brings out all the other smells of fall.
          <br><br>
          Walks outside, in the city or in the forest, feeling our cold cheeks get a little rosy, listening to some jazz or lofi as we sip on the drink of choice we just ordered from the little coffee shop down the street are so much better and comfy! All while the darkness of the clouds allow for the lights to reflect off the damp grounds...
          <br><br>
          On the bright side, rainy weather is so much better for watching movies because you don't get the sun blasting in the screen!
