        <h1>Looking for Warmth?</h1>

      <p>
        During spooky season, the weather begins to get quite cold. There is nothing like cozying up on the couch next to our loved ones or pets in a big soft blanket and a hot cocoa to watch some good movies or play some relaxing games while watching the clouds get moody outside!
        <br><br>
        Same thing with camping during spooky season! As it gets colder, we look to be closer to others and for warmth; bundled up in a big blanket by the fire, roasting marshmallows and enjoying the fresh smells of campfire, damp woods and falling leaves sounds like a delight!
        <br><br>
        It gets colder so grab your blankets, your pumpkin spice latte, your hot cocoa, your cat, your dog, your significant other and any other loved ones and stay warm. That's what the penguins do!
      </p>
